CHANGES IN KineticEval VERSION 1.0-4

NEW FEATURES

    added a function summay.kingui to summarize a model

    added a few example data sets

    added a demo named Complex_Model

CHANGES IN KineticEval VERSION 1.0-3

BUG FIXES

    fixed #1 FOMC model result is not calculated.
    fixed #2 DFOP DT90 is not correctly calculated.

CHANGES IN KineticEval VERSION 1.0-2

BUG FIXES

    fixed #0, DFOP model for metabolite is re-established in the correct form.

CHANGES IN KineticEval VERSION 1.0-1

NEW FEATURES

    first release of the package KineticEval: it covers most features in KinGUII and was developed based on the package mkinfit; see package homepage for documentation and examples: http://github.com/zhenglei-gao/KineticEval

    added two new optimization algorithms implementation

    added a demo named simple_KinEval

    added a function update_kin_mod to compare fitting results from different methods or algorithms.

MAJOR CHANGES

    DFOP model for metabolite is re-established in the correct form.

    Combined IRLSkinfit.full, mkinfit.full, mcmckinfit.full into a single function KinEval to avoid replicated codes.

BUG FIXES

    fixed #2: when DFOP k=0 or g=0, the calculation of DT50 and DT90 run into errors.
